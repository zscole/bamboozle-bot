Bamboozle Bot v0.1

Simple Reddit bot developed to parse comments on /r/all and respond to any instances of the word "bamboozle" with a comment offering bamboozle insurance. Users may opt in for bamboozle insurance for the low price of one upvote. 

This is meant to be a joke. There's no such thing as bamboozle insurance. It's just for fun, so lighten up. 

Work in progress. Need to format the comment better, but I'll do it later.
